If you’re dealing with computers, do you know how a computer works? how do they perceive things?</p><p>If you deal with a person, do you know how they perceive things? A simple miscommunication could easily lead you to a place where you don’t want to be.</p><h1 id=setting-a-clear-context-and-expectations>Setting a clear context and expectations</h1><p>clear expectations and context from the beginning would help the communication established nicely, for example, the reason why <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>C Programming Language</a> is designed with a header file, is to set common expectations either for other programmers that read it, or the compiler that is going to interpret it to a computer.</p><blockquote><p>The header file eliminates the labor of finding and changing all the copies as well as the risk that a failure to find one copy will result in inconsistencies within a program. In C, the usual convention is to give header files names that end with .</p></blockquote><p>Without clear expectations between two parties, there is always a big chance of miscommunication. Which happened every among humans or computers.</p><p>You always want to set a clear expectation of what the other party expect to receive, and one big important thing that would help with that is empathy. Without empathy, it would be pretty difficult to control how the receiver perceives what you’re trying to communicate.</p><p>In the Software Engineering world, it might be simpler, since computers understand math, and math is a precise language. But we humans, don’t talk math, that is why it takes more effort to understand who are you communicating, with and how they’re going to perceive it.</p><h1 id=closure>Closure</h1><p>We interact with everything in our life, other human beings, animals, computers, plants, and foods. And we are all built using the same physical attribute forming chemical reactions and becoming biological creatures and living in a society.</p><p>It wouldn’t hurt you to try to understand others :)</p><p><em>Bonus references: there are multiple archetypes of software engineer which probably would help you to understand beforehand</em></p><p><a href=https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes>https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes</a></p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="ml-auto flex w-1/2 items-center justify-end rounded-r-md p-6 pl-3 font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-black/[2%] dark:hover:bg-white/[3%]" href=https://blog.alileza.me/posts/good-observability-is-simply-better-than-good-testing/><span>Good observability is simply more important than good testing</span><span class=ml-1.5>→</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class="opaco mx-auto flex h-[4.5rem] max-w-3xl items-center px-8 text-[0.9em] opacity-60"><div class=mr-auto>&copy; 2024
